![Alicia Marie Tan](./about.png)

I'm a writer and editor focusing on culture, lifestyle, identity, and technology. I'm an assistant editor at Harper, the flagship imprint of HarperCollins, where I'm interested in working on culturally relevant, thought-provoking literary and upmarket fiction from underrepresented voices, as well as nonfiction, including essay collections, memoir, cultural studies, self-help, humor, social science, and more. I'm also the co-editor of <i>Tart Magazine</i>, an arts and literary magazine forthcoming in 2019.

Previously, I was an editorial assistant at Abrams, where I worked on narrative nonfiction and art books, including the <i>New York Times</i>â€“bestselling biography on Fred Rogers, <i>The Good Neighbor</i>; Viet Thanh Nguyen's anthology <i>The Displaced</i>; Jon Contino's design monograph <i>Brand by Hand</i>; and the forthcoming memoir <i>To Be Honest</i> by Michael Leviton.

My words have been featured in print and online at Mashable, RadioTimes.com, and more. I'm based in Brooklyn, New York, where I spend my time eating flamin' hot cheetos and watching <i>Terrace House</i>. I'll never let you forget I'm from Texas.
