![Alicia Marie Tan](./about.png)

Alicia Tan is an assistant editor at Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins, a founder of the literary magazine <i>Tart</i>, and a writer. Her words have been featured in print and online at Mashable, RadioTimes.com, and more. Previously, she was an editorial assistant at Abrams. A born-and-raised Texan, she’s currently based in Brooklyn.

Throughout her career, she’s worked on a wide range of narrative nonfiction, literary and commercial fiction, and illustrated books, including Maxwell King’s <i>New York Times</i>–bestselling biography of Fred Rogers, <i>The Good Neighbor</i> and Viet Thanh Nguyen’s anthology on the refugee experience, <i>The Displaced</i>.

Are you an agent who's interested in submitting to her? Here's what she's actively looking for:

— Literary fiction about people from misrepresented communities engaging with themes of art, ambition, power, sex, and gender—especially from women and people of color

— Literary fiction with rich, complex character studies and narratives that push the envelope on what’s dark, gross, and shameful, yet comforting in their honest and edifying depictions of human behavior

— Nonfiction that analyzes media, pop culture, and “low-brow” art in a fresh, nuanced way, especially as it pertains to our behavior, identities, and our world at large

— Nonfiction that engages with race, the Asian and Asian American diaspora, and multigenerational trauma

** She is not interested in: historical fiction, YA, romance, self-help, or thrillers
