![Alicia Marie Tan](./about.png)

Alicia Tan is a writer focusing on culture and identity and an assistant editor at Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins.

She’s interested in editing culturally relevant, provocative nonfiction and literary fiction from underrepresented voices. She’s especially excited about narratives that explore the lives of millennial women; rethink gender, sex, and power; engage with race, the Asian and Asian American diaspora, and multigenerational trauma; and question the consumption and effects of media and pop culture. She is also a co-founder of <i>Tart</i>, an arts and literary magazine.

Previously, she was an editorial assistant at Abrams, where she worked on narrative nonfiction and art books, including the <i>New York Times</i>–bestselling biography on Fred Rogers, <i>The Good Neighbor</i>; Viet Thanh Nguyen's anthology <i>The Displaced</i>; Jon Contino's design monograph <i>Brand by Hand</i>; and the forthcoming memoir <i>To Be Honest</i> by Michael Leviton.

Her words have been featured in print and online at Mashable, RadioTimes.com, and more. A born-and-raised Texan, she's currently based in Brooklyn, where she spends her time eating flamin' hot cheetos and watching <i>Terrace House</i>.
