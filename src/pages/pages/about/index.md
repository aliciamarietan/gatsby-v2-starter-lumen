![Alicia Marie Tan](./about.png)

I'm a writer and editor focusing on culture, lifestyle, identity, and technology. I am the co-editor of <i>Tart Magazine</i>, an art and literary magazine forthcoming in 2019. During the day, I work on narrative nonfiction and art books at Abrams. I'm based in Brooklyn, New York, where I spend my time eating flamin' hot cheetos and watching <i>Terrace House</i>. I'll never let you forget I'm from Texas.
