![Alicia Marie Tan](./about.png)

Alicia Tan is an assistant editor at Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins, a co-founder of the literary magazine <i>Tart</i>, and a writer. Previously, she was an editorial assistant at Abrams, where she worked on narrative nonfiction and illustrated books. Her words have been featured in print and online at Mashable, RadioTimes.com, and more. A born-and-raised Texan, she's currently based in Brooklyn, where she spends her time eating flamin' hot cheetos and watching <i>Terrace House</i>.

<b>Are you a literary agent hoping to connect?</b> Alicia is interested in literary fiction and narrative nonfiction that explore the lives of millennial women; rethink gender, sex, love, and power; engage with race, the Asian and Asian American diaspora, and multigenerational trauma; and  analyze media and pop culture consumption. She's especially excited about fiction with rich, complex character studies and narratives that push the envelope on what's dark, gross, and shameful, yet comforting in their honest and edifying depictions of human behavior, as well as nonfiction that elevates the voices of those on the margins of society.
